# Final_ML_project
Final project in 'introduction to machine learning' course at Tel-Aviv University, 
Faculty of Engineering, as a part of the BS.c degree 'Digital Sciences for High-Tech'.
In this project, we were given a big dataset including 25 features where each observations describes a day.
Our role is to build models that will predict the probability of a rainy day.
Our project deals with Binary Classification: '1' - is a rainy day or '0' - not a rainy day.
Some of the features are unknown.
